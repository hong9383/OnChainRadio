
# OnChainRadio

OnChainRadio is a Move smart contract for **MP2: OnChain Radio** on the Aptos blockchain. This project leverages the power of blockchain technology to provide decentralized, transparent, and secure on-chain radio services.

## Features

-   **Move Smart Contract**: Implements core functionalities of OnChainRadio using the Move programming language.
    
-   **Decentralized Audio Streaming**: Allows users to stream and access radio content directly on-chain.
    
-   **Immutable Metadata**: Stores audio metadata securely and permanently on the Aptos blockchain.
    
-   **Permissionless Access**: Users can interact with OnChainRadio without the need for a centralized authority.
    
-   **Transparent and Secure**: Ensures fair and tamper-proof content distribution.
